Just a stupid `cal`.

## Installation

Please do not install it.

If you insist to do so:

    $ gem install dcal

## Usage

The `dcal` command would be installed with the gem.

It works almost like the `cal` command, but stupider.

Provide it the numbers of month and year:

    $ dcal 12 2012

And the output would be like:

```
   December 2012
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
                   1
 2  3  4  5  6  7  8
 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
16 17 18 19 20 21 22
23 24 25 26 27 28 29
30 31
```

No any other fancier functionality.

## Compatibility

Compatible with Ruby 2.0.0-dev.

Please install Bundler 1.3.0+ by running:

    $ gem install bundler --pre
